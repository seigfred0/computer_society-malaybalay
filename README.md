- Yee, here's the mongodb data format
- `attendanceRoutes.mjs` = I commented the routes not yet done. Kindly make progress of the following especially the createStudent.
    - generate student qr code inside the function and save it to the database with their name and year
    - send the qr code to the client 

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "671239bcad710001df42e410"
  },
  "students": [
    {
      "name": "dsfsdfsds",
      "year": "2nd year",
      "uid": "1159"
    },
    {
      "name": "dsfsdfsds",
      "year": "2nd year",
      "uid": "1159"
    }
  ],
  "master_list": [],
  "attendance": [
    {
      "id": "",
      "name": "",
      "year": "",
      "date": ""
    }
  ],
  "uid": "attendance"
